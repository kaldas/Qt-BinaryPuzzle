# Qt-BinaryPuzzle

Binary puzzles are a Sudoku-like game where a grid must be filled with 0 and 1 under some conditions: each cell should contain a zero or a one; no more than two similar numbers below or next to each other are allowed; each row and each column is unique and contains as many zeros as ones. Grids contain some initial marking and the goal is to fill the empty cells.
